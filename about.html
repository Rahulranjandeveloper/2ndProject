            <h1>About us</h1> <br><br>
            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Rahul Ranjan and i belongs to (muzaffarpur) Bihar. If i talk about my education qualification, during my intermediate i was a commerce background student completed from GYAN NIKETAN, (Patna)Bihar where i was much more intrested in sports, as Sports is my 1st hobby and took particaption in many sports events like (Cricket, Villeyball, Kabbadi, Football and running 100,200,400meters, relay) and got many awards & achievements.
                After completing my intermediate i took admission at Magadh Univercity in B.com honrs and side by side i was preparing for CA & CS but due to very least intrests in these field, i decided to take dropout from Commerce & finance stream and Joined Institute of Hotel Management Gangtok (Sikkim) for B.sc in hospitality & hotel administration. During my 1st year only i got to know the dark reality of Hotel management and
                 there also i was not getting much more intrest but this time i can't take dropout. so continued with that course and done Industrial training in 2nd year from NOVOTEL kolkata. My IT exposure was really good, got to learn a lot of skills from there.</p>

            <h3>Tittle 01</h3>
            <p>A paragraph could be part of a text that informs people, describes something, critiques something, compares things, persuades people, lists a process, makes an argument, offers a solution, or narrates a story. The level of detail will vary from text to text, so there is no answer to the question</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column25 bordersection">
            <i class="fas fa-location"></i>
            <h3>Tittle 02</h3>
            <p>This diversity means that it's not always easy to determine what "one topic" means when dividing your text into paragraphs. For example, you could have a one-topic paragraph describing Venus (with the next paragraph describing Mars) or a one-topic paragraph describing the hues of a sunset (with the next paragraph describing its reflection in the sea).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column25 bordersection">
            <i class="fas fa-cloud"></i>
            <h3>Tittle 03</h3>
            <p>That is another question that cannot be answered. Sometimes, a paragraph will be an aspect of a topic, sometimes it will be a topic within an issue, sometimes it will be an issue within an argument...a narrative, a process, a comparison, whatever. Whatever the scope of your paragraph, it should be neatly bounded as one aspect. If you prefer "aspect" instead of "topic," go with that</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column25 bordersection">
            <i class="fas fa-building"></i>
            <h3>Tittle 04</h3>
            <p>A good tip for business writing is to give each of your paragraphs a title that summarizes the paragraph content. This serves two purposes. Firstly, it ensures your paragraph topic is neatly bounded, and, secondly, the title will assist busy executives with skim-reading.</p>
